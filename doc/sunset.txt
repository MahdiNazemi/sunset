INTRODUCTION                                    *sunset* *sunset-introduction*

Sunset automatically sets |'background'| when you start Vim, and also at the
local sunrise and sunset times for your location. When the sun is up, it'll
'set background=light' and when the sun is down, it'll 'set background=dark'.

You must set some options in your '.vimrc' for this to work, so
please read on to |sunset-options| for details.

If you feel that Sunset can be improved, pull requests and issues are
appreciated and humbly requested, on Github at: http://github.com/amdt/sunset

OPTIONS                                                     *sunset-options*

'g:loaded_sunset'                                           *'loaded_sunset'*

Set to a non-0 value to disable Sunset, for example:

    let g:loaded_sunset = 1

'g:sunset_latitude' & 'g:sunset_longitude'                        *lat-long*
                                                          *'sunset_latitude'*
                                                         *'sunset_longitude'*

Note: If you push your dotfiles to Github, please see |sunset-privacy|.

The latitude and longitude of your location in decimal. Values North and East
must be positive values, those South and West must be negative.

London, for example, lies at 51 degrees, 30 minutes North; and 7 minutes West.

In decimal, this is 51.5 degrees North, 0.1167 degrees West.

If you lived in London, you might set these options as follows:

    let g:sunset_latitude = 51.5
    let g:sunset_longitude = -0.1167

If you lived in Tokyo (35 degrees, 40 minutes and 12 seconds North; 139
degrees, 46 minutes and 12 seconds East), you might set these options
as follows:

    let g:sunset_latitude = 35.67
    let s:sunset_longitude = 139.8

Note: Don't forget, negative values South and West.

'g:sunset_utc_offset'                                   *'sunset_utc_offset'*

The difference in hours between your timezone and Coordinated Universal Time.

For example:

    let g:sunset_utc_offset = 0 " London
    let g:sunset_utc_offset = 1 " London (British Summer Time)
    let g:sunset_utc_offset = 9 " Tokyo

Note: Sunset does not handle any daylight savings civil times.

A REMINDER OF PRIVACY                                       *sunset-privacy*

For those of us who publish our dotfiles on Github etc., please take this
as a gentle reminder that out of habit you might be about to publish your
whereabouts to the greater public. If this concerns you, using the location of
your nearest large city might suffice; Sunset will be plenty accurate enough.

CREDIT                                                       *sunset-credit*

Sunset uses an algorithm for finding the local sunrise and sunset times
published in the Almanac for Computers, 1990, by the Nautical Almanac Office of
the United States Naval Observatory, as
